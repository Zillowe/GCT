## üöÄ Getting Started

The first thing you should do after installation is set up your AI provider. GCT includes an interactive wizard to make this easy. In your project directory, run:

```sh
gct init
```

This will guide you through selecting an AI provider, setting your model, and adding your API key to create a local `gct.yaml` configuration file.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

The `gct init` command creates a `gct.yaml` file in your project's root directory. This file holds the configuration for all AI-related commands.

**Example `gct.yaml`:**

```yaml
name: "GCT"
guides:
  - ./etc/Commits.md
provider: "OpenRouter" # Supported: "OpenAI", "Google AI Studio", "Anthropic", "OpenRouter"
model: "google/gemma-2-9b-it" # The model name from your chosen provider
api: "sk-or-v1-abc...123" # Your API Key
```

- `provider`: The AI service you want to use.
- `model`: The specific model name from that provider (e.g. `gpt-4o`, `claude-3-haiku-20240307`).
- `api`: Your secret API key from the provider's dashboard.
- `guides`: A list of local Markdown or text files that provide style guidelines for the AI to follow.
